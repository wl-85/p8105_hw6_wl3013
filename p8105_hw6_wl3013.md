Cities vary widely in the adjusted odds of a homicide being solved for
male vs female victims. Most cities have odds ratios close to 1,
indicating little difference in clearance likelihood by victim gender
after adjusting for age and race. However, a few cities show large OR
with wide confidence intervals, suggesting unstable estimates driven by
small sample sizes or separation issues in the data. Also, several
cities have OR below 1, implying that homicides of male victims may be
less likely to be solved compared with female victims, while others show
the opposite pattern.
